## Invert a Binary Tree

### Description
Invert a Binary Tree

This basically takes a binary Tree (given below)

```javascript
     4
   /   \
  2     7
 / \   / \
1   3 6   9
```

and swaps the LEFT and RIGHT nodes. So the above tree has to be transformed to:

```javascript
     4
   /   \
  7     2
 / \   / \
9   6 3   1
```
